knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

### 3. Download the Dragon Phylogeny nexus data and append your dragons to the dataset. Save this in a folder called 'input' and add one line coding characteristics for each of your 3 dragons.

```{r}
library(ape)
library(reshape2)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggtree)
DragonNexus<-read.nexus.data("~/Desktop/432 Assignment Week 7/input/DragonMatrix.nex")
head(DragonNexus)
names(DragonNexus)
```

### 4. Apply the same trait weightings as those used in the Dragon Phylogeny Tutorial.

```{r}
WeightsDat<-read.csv("~/Desktop/432 Assignment Week 7/input/Weights.csv")
```

We are now going to create a single vector for the weights
```{r}
Weights<-paste0(WeightsDat$Weight,collapse="")
Weights<-strsplit(Weights,split="")[[1]]
```

Now we will change each letter iunto a value
```{r}
LETTERS
```
```{r}
which(LETTERS=="G")
```
```{r}
WeightsNum<-rep(NA,length(Weights))
for(i in 1:length(WeightsNum)){
  if(Weights[i] %in% LETTERS){
    WeightsNum[i]<-which(LETTERS==Weights[i])+9
  } else {
    WeightsNum[i]<-Weights[i]
  }
}
WeightsNum<-as.numeric(WeightsNum)
```

Now that we have a vector of weights, we check to make sure that we have the same amount of numbers as the 0's and 1's from the Dragon matrix. 
```{r}
length(WeightsNum)
```

We are now going to Multiply the weight value by the trait vector for each dragon. Things get complicated in this data set because it is composed of 0, 1 and ?. We know that 0 multiplied by any weight is 0, ? multiplied by a weight is undefined and so all that's left is the weight multiplied by the 1's. To do this, we also have to slice our list object using the double brackets [[]]. 

```{r}
WtDragonNexus<-DragonNexus # Make a new weighted data frame object
for (i in 1:length(DragonNexus)){
  RepWeight<-DragonNexus[[i]]==1
  WtDragonNexus[[i]][RepWeight]<-WeightsNum[RepWeight]
  RepWeight<-NA
}
```

How by modifying our objects, we re-calculate our distance matrix

```{r}
WtDragonNexusDF<-data.frame(matrix(unlist(WtDragonNexus),ncol=78,byrow=T))
row.names(WtDragonNexusDF)<-names(WtDragonNexus)
WtDragonDist<-dist(WtDragonNexusDF,method='euclidean')
WtDragonDistMat<-as.matrix(WtDragonDist)
```

Here is our matrix:

```{r}
WtPDat<-melt(WtDragonDistMat)
ggplot(data = WtPDat, aes(x=Var1, y=Var2, fill=value)) + 
  geom_tile()+scale_fill_gradientn(colours=c("white","blue","green","red")) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5))
```


### 5. Embed images showing your dragon choices in your R markdown report.

### 6. Create a visually attractive phylogeny. Use coloured lines to highlight the lineages where your dragons appear on the Dragon Phylogeny.

```{r}
DragonNexusDF<-data.frame(matrix(unlist(DragonNexus), ncol=78,byrow=T))
row.names(DragonNexusDF)<-names(DragonNexus)
head(DragonNexusDF)
DragonDist<-dist(DragonNexusDF,method='binary')
DragonDistMat<-as.matrix(DragonDist)
```

```{r}
PDat<-melt(DragonDistMat)
# Using the library reshape2 we are going to rearrange the n*n matrix we currently have to a n^2 by 3 matrix in order to visualize our matrix with ggplot.
```

```{r}
dim(DragonDistMat)
# We are taking a look at the layout of our current matix.
```

```{r}
dim(PDat)
```

```{r}
head(PDat)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = PDat, aes(x=Var1, y=Var2, fill=value)) + 
  geom_tile()+scale_fill_gradientn(colours=c("white","blue","green","red")) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5))
```

Now we are going to plot our tree:

```{r}
WtDragonTree<-fastme.bal(WtDragonDist)
ggtree(WtDragonTree,layout="circular")
```

Let's try and modify our data to make our tree look better

```{r}
str(WtDragonTree)
```

The tip labels contain information about the origin of each dragon image which we can see as follows

```{r}
head(WtDragonTree$tip.label)
```

We are going to use the tops to colour code our tree

```{r}
Country<-gsub("[0-9\\.]+([^X]+)X*","\\1",WtDragonTree$tip.label) # Remove leading numbers
```

Next we have to group tip.labels by their corresponding country.

```{r}
CountryGroups<-split(WtDragonTree$tip.label, Country)
WtDTcol<-groupOTU(WtDragonTree,CountryGroups)
str(WtDTcol)
```

#### Here is my final phylogenetic tree with all of the dinosaurs!

```{r}
library(sparcl)
ggtree(WtDTcol, 
       branch.length = "none", 
       layout = "circular", 
       aes(colour = group)) +
  geom_tiplab(size = 2, 
              aes(angle = angle)) +
  geom_rootpoint(color = "white", 
                 size = 3, 
                 alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_nodepoint(colour = "light pink", 
                 size = 3, 
                 alpha = 0.5) +
  theme_tree("black")  # adding the black background helps the colour pop and the names to be more easily read
```
